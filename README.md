# Anomaly_detection_Fooddelivery
In this project,explore the critical role of anomaly detection in food
delivery dataset. Anomalies, deviations from expected behavior, have a
significant impact on operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and
reliability. Our journey begins with data cleaning, followed by exploratory
data analysis to understand the dataset's nuances. We then delve into
model building, utilizing various techniques for anomaly detection.
